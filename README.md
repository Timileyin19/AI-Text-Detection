# AI Text Detection using Eden AI API

This project demonstrates the implementation of AI text detection using the Eden AI API within a Vite application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Timileyin19/AI-Text-Detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd AI-Text-Detection
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Replace the `.env.sample` file:

   - Duplicate the `.env.sample` file and rename it to `.env`.
